# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Poe-s-Corpus
I visualized Edgar Allan Poe's Corpus of Stories and conducted a sentiment analysis. The most interesting result for me here was that Poe's stories had a positive meaning. Some of you may know that he was a depressed person and most of his stories were about fear. Maybe he was someone who liked to use sentences which are negative in meaning and affirmative in structure.
